# Desktop-Voice-Assistant

This is Desktop voice assistant program, the programm is written in python language. I would say
this program is basic and simple example of how AI machines works. In my program 
if user is asking for time, any wikipedia, if user wanted to open web browser by saying open (google, youtube, and stackoverflow). 
These are the basic features that I added on my program. Once users open They'll like it.
